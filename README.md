Web application to search podcast and her episodes developed with react, typescript, , redux, css modules and vite.

## Features

<dl>
  <dt>Clean Architecture</dt>
  <dd>You can design applications with very low coupling and independent of technical implementation details, such as databases and frameworks. That way, the application becomes easy to maintain and flexible to change. It also becomes intrinsically testable. Here Iâ€™ll show how I structure my clean architecture projects. </dd>

  <dt>Next generation JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more.</dd>

  <dt>Redux with Redux Toolkit</dt>
  <dd>It helps us to structure our application as far as state management is concerned, understanding state as that information of the application, which when its value changes, causes said application to be updated to represent the change.</dd>

  <dt>CSS Modules</dt>
  <dd>CSS Modules is a CSS framework that allows you to write CSS classes and animations that have a default local scope and thus avoid the problems caused by global scope in CSS.</dd>

  <dt>Vitest</dt>
  <dd>Vite native test runner</dd>
